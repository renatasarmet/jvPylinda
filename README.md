# Instrutions
Distributed Systems Project 1

## Before you begin,
adjust the server host in constCS.py and make sure everyone is using the same port.

#### IMPORTANT: Files inside the linda folder should not be run directly.

## On the server side, 
run the server.py file that is in the root folder.

## On the client side, 
run any example that is in the root folder. You can create a new one containing the information you prefer. If you choose to create, be sure to import linda and use the instructions in the appropriate format.

## To make life easier, 
the example_all_op.py file containing the out, rd, and in statements was created to demonstrate all operations.
