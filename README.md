## Instruções

### Before you begin
Adjust the server host in `constCS.py` and make sure everyone is using the same port.

#### **WARNING:** Files inside the linda folder should not be run directly.

### On the server side 
Run the `server.py` file that is in the root folder.

```bash
python server.py
```

### On the client side 
Run any example that is in the root folder (`alice-src`, `bob-src`, `chuck-src`). You can create a new one containing the information you prefer. If you choose to create, be sure to import linda and use the instructions in the appropriate format.

### One example to rule them all
The `example_all_op.py` file containing the `out`, `rd`, and `in` statements was created to demonstrate all operations.
```bash
python example_all_op.py
```
